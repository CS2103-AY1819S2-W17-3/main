== Introduction

[blue]#Welcome to the _In-Credit-Ble_ Developer Guide!#

_In-Credit-Ble_ is a finance tracker application created to simplify the managing and tracking
of the user’s personal finances. With _In-Credit-Ble_, users will be able to stick to their budget
and be more aware of their spending habits.

This developer guide specifies the design and implementation of _In-Credit-Ble_. The intended audience of
this document is the developers, designers and software testers of our application.

Please continue on to the <<Setting Up, [underline blue]#Setting Up#>> section to get started. You can also read <<AboutUs#, [blue]#AboutUs.adoc#>>
and <<ContactUs#, [blue]#ContactUs.adoc#>> for more information on how to contact us!

== Setting Up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `[fuchsia]#9#`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `[fuchsia]#10#` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, [blue]#headless mode#>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[[blue]#JavaFX bug#].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `[fuchsia]#9#`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to menu:File[Settings > Plugins] to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click menu:File[Close Project] to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click menu:Configure[Project Defaults > Project Structure]
.. Click btn:[New...] and find the directory of the JDK
. Click btn:[Import Project]
. Locate the `[fuchsia]#build.gradle#` file and select it. Click btn:[OK]
. Click btn:[Open as Project]
. Click btn:[OK] to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `[fuchsia]#gradlew processResources#` (Mac/Linux: `[fuchsia]#./gradlew processResources#`). It should finish with the `[fuchsia]#BUILD SUCCESSFUL#` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/ui/MainWindow.java[`[blue]#MainWindow.java#`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[[blue]#issue#] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in [red]#red#. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select btn:[Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options] for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/finance/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`[blue]#HelpWindowTest.java#`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `[fuchsia]#seedu.finance.MainApp#` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,[underline blue]#Run the tests#>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[[blue]#oss-generic coding standards#]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to menu:File[Settings...] (Windows/Linux), or menu:IntelliJ IDEA[Preferences...] (macOS)
. Select menu:Editor[Code Style > Java]
. Click on the btn:[Imports] tab to set the order

* For btn:[Class count to use import with '\*'] and btn:[Names count to use static import with '*']: Set to `[fuchsia]#999#` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For btn:[Import Layout]: The order is `[fuchsia]#import static all other imports#`, `[fuchsia]#import java.\*#`, `[fuchsia]#import javax.*#`, `[fuchsia]#import org.\*#`, `[fuchsia]#import com.*#`, `[fuchsia]#import all other imports#`. Add a btn:[<blank line>] between each `[fuchsia]#import#`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, [blue]#UsingCheckstyle.adoc#>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still refer to the `[fuchsia]#CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main#` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `[fuchsia]#In-Credit-Ble#`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, [underline blue]#site-wide documentation settings#>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`[blue]#build.gradle#`], such as the `[fuchsia]#site-name#`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `[fuchsia]#repoURL#` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`[blue]#DeveloperGuide.adoc#`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`[blue]#UserGuide.adoc#`] with the URL of your fork.


==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, [blue]#UsingTravis.adoc#>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, [blue]#UsingCoveralls.adoc#>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, [blue]#UsingAppVeyor.adoc#>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading [underline blue]#<<Design-Architecture>>#.
2. Take a look at [underline blue]#<<GetStartedProgramming>>#.


== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* above explains the high-level design of _In-Credit-Ble_. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `[fuchsia]#.pptx#` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[[blue]#diagrams#] folder.
To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose btn:[Save as picture].

`[fuchsia]#Main#` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/MainApp.java[`[blue]#MainApp#`]. It is responsible for,

* App launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* App shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`[underline blue]#Commons#`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `[fuchsia]#LogsCenter#` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`[underline blue]#UI#`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`[underline blue]#Logic#`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`[underline blue]#Model#`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`[underline blue]#Storage#`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `[fuchsia]#interface#` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `[fuchsia]#{Component Name}Manager#` class.

For example, the `[fuchsia]#Logic#` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `[fuchsia]#Logic.java#` interface and
exposes its functionality using the `[fuchsia]#LogicManager.java#` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How do the architecture components interact with each other?

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `[fuchsia]#delete 1#`.

.Component interactions for `[fuchsia]#delete 1#` command
image::SDforDeleteRecord.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::UI[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/ui/Ui.java[`[blue]#Ui.java#`]

The UI consists of a `[fuchsia]#MainWindow#` that is made up of parts e.g.`[fuchsia]#CommandBox#`, `[fuchsia]#ResultDisplay#`, `[fuchsia]#RecordListPanel#`,
`[fuchsia]#StatusBarFooter#`, `[fuchsia]#BrowserPanel#`, `[fuchsia]#BudgetPanel#`, `[fuchsia]#SummaryPanel#` etc. All these, including the `[fuchsia]#MainWindow#`,
inherit from the abstract `[fuchsia]#UiPart#` class.

The `[fuchsia]#UI#` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `[fuchsia]#.fxml#` files that are in the `[fuchsia]#src/main/resources/view#` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/ui/MainWindow.java[`[blue]#MainWindow#`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`[blue]#MainWindow.fxml#`]

The `[fuchsia]#UI#` component,

* Executes user commands using the `[fuchsia]#Logic#` component.
* Listens for changes to `[fuchsia]#Model#` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
// end::UI[]

// tag::logic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/logic/Logic.java[`[blue]#Logic.java#`]

.  `[fuchsia]#Logic#` uses the `[fuchsia]#FinanceTrackerParser#` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `[fuchsia]#Command#` object which is executed by the `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#`.
.  The command execution can affect the `[fuchsia]#Model#` (e.g. adding a record).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `[fuchsia]#CommandResult#` object which is passed back to the `[fuchsia]#Ui#`.
.  In addition, the `[fuchsia]#CommandResult#` object can also instruct the `[fuchsia]#Ui#` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
help to the user.
// end::logic[]
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `[fuchsia]#Logic#` component for the `[fuchsia]#execute("delete 1")#` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `[fuchsia]#delete 1#` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/model/Model.java[`[blue]#Model.java#`]

The `[fuchsia]#Model#` component,

* stores a `[fuchsia]#UserPref#` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Finance Tracker data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `[fuchsia]#ObservableList<Record>#` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so
that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
// end::model[]

// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/storage/Storage.java[`[blue]#Storage.java#`]

The `[fuchsia]#Storage#` component,

* can save `[fuchsia]#UserPref#` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Finance Tracker data in json format and read it back.
// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `[fuchsia]#seedu.financetracker.commons#` package.



== Implementation

This section describes in detail the implementation of certain features in _In-Credit-Ble_.

// tag::search[]
=== Search feature

This feature allows the user to filter out specific expenses based on keywords that correspond to the name, category
or date.

This implementation is under `[fuchsia]#Logic#` and `[fuchsia]#Model#` Component.

==== Current Implementation
The search command uses predicates that implement `[fuchsia]#java.util.Predicate#` interface which will be used to filter the records
that are inputted into the finance tracker. Each of these predicates contains a `[fuchsia]#List<String>#` of keywords and a `[fuchsia]#test()#`
command that is used to test if a record satisfy the conditions set in the predicate. These predicates are found in the `[fuchsia]#Model#` component.

.Predicates implemented in `[fuchsia]#Model#` component
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Types of predicate |Functions|
`[fuchsia]#CategoryContainsKeywordsPredicate#` | Filter out records by a given category |
`[fuchsia]#DateContainsKeywordsPredicate#` | Filter out records by a given date |
`[fuchsia]#NameContainsKeywordPredicate#` | Filter out records with names that matches a keyword |
|===

Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of an example usage scenario.

.Sequence Diagram of Search Command
image::SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

1. User enters a search command ([navy]#eg.# `[fuchsia]#search -cat food#`). The command is received by the UI components and the method
`[fuchsia]#LogicManger#execute()#` is called.

2. The command is received by `[fuchsia]#FinanceTrackerParser#`, which then creates a
`[fuchsia]#SearchCommandParser#` Object and calls `[fuchsia]#SearchCommandParser#parse()#` method.

3. Depending on the `[fuchsia]#-FLAG#` that is entered by the user, `[fuchsia]#SearchCommandParser#` will create different predicates objects
that correspond to the `[fuchsia]#-FLAG#`.
* If `[fuchsia]#-cat#` is inputted, `[fuchsia]#CategoryContainsKeywordsPredicate#` will be created.
* If `[fuchsia]#-date#` is inputted, `[fuchsia]#DateContainsKeywordPredicate#` will be created.
* If `[fuchsia]#-name#` is inputted, `[fuchsia]#NameContainsKeywordPredicate#` will be created.

4. A `[fuchsia]#SearchCommand#` Object with the correct predicate Object as parameter is created and returned to the
`[fuchsia]#FinanceTrackerParser#` and then to the `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#`.

5. `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#` then calls `[fuchsia]#SearchCommand#execute()#`, which calls `[fuchsia]#Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()#` method
to update the predicate of `[fuchsia]#FilterList<Record>#`. `[fuchsia]#FilterList<Record>#` now contains a new set of records which is filtered
by the new predicate.

6. `[fuchsia]#SearchCommand#` then calls `[fuchsia]#getFilteredRecordList#` method to access the filtered records in an
`[fuchsia]#ObservableList<Record>#` in order to calculate the sum of the money that is spent in all the filtered records.

7. Then the record list panel will show a set of records according to the keywords. A `[fuchsia]#CommandResult#` is then created
and returned to `[fuchsia]#Logic Manager#`.

==== Design Consideration

This feature can be implemented in different ways in terms of how the records are found.

* *Alternative 1* : Check through all records and select those with the matched keywords based on the flag.

** Pros: Easy to implement without changing original architecture.
** Cons: Slow. Tend to take a long time to search through large number of records.

* *Alternative 2* : Each time a new category/date is called when making a record, create a new list. Each of these list
will hold all the records that correspond to these category or dates.

** Pros: Very efficient, each time the command is called, just need to retrieve the list of the wanted field.
** Cons: Need to change the original architecture of storage to introduce storing of different list corresponding to
each tag. Will take up more space if there is many different tags.

We have implemented *Alternative 1* as we want the search function to be more dynamic and more generic to accept
accept different kind of search in the future implementation. If we were to choose *Alternative 2*, the search
conditions will only be restricted to category and date where it is likely for different records to have the same
value (eg. same date or same category). However, it is not feasible to create a different list for every single name
that is inputted into the finance tracker.

// end::search[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort feature

By default, the list of entries is ordered according to the time the entry is entered into the application,
where the entry entered first will be at the top of the list, and the entry entered last is at the bottom of the list.
The sort mechanism allows users to view their expense records in a different way.


==== Current Implementation

The sort command uses comparators that implement `[fuchsia]#java.util.Comparator#` interface to provide the comparison functions.

.Sort commands (default ordering)
|===
|Command |Comparator used |Effect

|`[fuchsia]#sort -name#`, `[fuchsia]#sort -name -asc#`|`[fuchsia]#RecordNameComparator#` |Lexicographical order
|`[fuchsia]#sort -amount#`, `[fuchsia]#sort -amount -desc#` |`[fuchsia]#RecordAmountComparator#` |Descending order
|`[fuchsia]#sort -date#`, `[fuchsia]#sort -date -desc#`|`[fuchsia]#RecordDateComparator#` |Reverse chronological order
|`[fuchsia]#sort -cat#`, `[fuchsia]#sort -cat -asc#` |`[fuchsia]#RecordCategoryComparator#` |Lexicographical order

|===


.Sort commands (Specified order opposite to that of default)
|===
|Command |Comparator used |Effect

|`[fuchsia]#sort -name -desc#` |`[fuchsia]#RecordNameComparator#reversed()#` |Reverse lexicographical order
|`[fuchsia]#sort -amount - asc#` |`[fuchsia]#RecordAmountComparator#reversed()#` |Ascending order
|`[fuchsia]#sort -date - asc#` |`[fuchsia]#RecordDateComparator#reversed()#` |Chronological order
|`[fuchsia]#sort -cat -desc#` |`[fuchsia]#RecordCategoryComparator#reversed()#` |Reverse lexicographical order

|===

Here is the list of operations involved in the execution of command, `[fuchsia]#sort -name#`.

. `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#execute(_"sort -name"_)#` calls `[fuchsia]#FinanceTrackerParser#parseCommand(_"sort -name"_)#`.
. `[fuchsia]#FinanceTracker#parseCommand(_"sort -name"_)#` creates a new `[fuchsia]#SortCommandParser#` object and calls `[fuchsia]#SortCommandParser#parse(_" -name"_)#`.
. `[fuchsia]#SortCommandParser#parse()#` creates a new `[fuchsia]#RecordNameComparator()#` object, _comparator_ and passes it as a parameter into the `[fuchsia]#SortCommand#` constructor.
. The `[fuchsia]#SortCommand#` object, _s_, is then passed back to the `[fuchsia]#SortCommandParser#`, `[fuchsia]#FinanceTrackerParser#`, and finally back to the `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#`.
+
.Sequence Diagram of Sort Command I
image::SortSequenceDiagram1.png[width="800"]
+
. `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#execute(_"sort -name"_)#` then continues to call `[fuchsia]#SortCommand#execute()#`.
. `[fuchsia]#SortCommand#execute()#` calls `[fuchsia]#Model#SortFilteredRecordList(_comparator_)#`.
. `[fuchsia]#Model#SortFilteredRecordList(_comparator_)#` calls `[fuchsia]#FinanceTracker#sortRecordList(_comparator_)#`.
. `[fuchsia]#FinanceTracker#sortRecordList(_comparator_)#` calls `[fuchsia]#UniqueRecordList#sortList(_comparator_)#`.
. `[fuchsia]#UniqueRecordList#sortList(_comparator_)#` then uses `[fuchsia]#FXCollection#`’s static method `[fuchsia]#sort()#`  to sort the records.
. `[fuchsia]#SortCommand#execute()#` then creates a `[fuchsia]#CommandResult#` object and returns it back to the `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#`.

.Sequence Diagram of Sort Command II
image::SortSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How sort is executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the `[fuchsia]#Comparator#` interface.

** Pros 1: Sorting can be done based on different attributes of the records (name, amount, date, category).
** Pros 2: Allows an alternative ordering to be applied, does not have to be the natural ordering. Therefore, dates can be sorted in reverse chronological order, and amount in descending order.
** Cons: A new class that implements the interface `[fuchsia]#Comparator#` needs to be created.

* **Alternative 2:** Use the `[fuchsia]#Comparable#` interface.

** Pros: Type-safe with compiler as `[fuchsia]#Comparable#compareTo()#` only accepts object of type `[fuchsia]#T#`, instead of `[fuchsia]#java.lang.Object#`.
** Cons 1: There can only be one form or way of sorting the records.
** Cons 2: Uses the natural order for sorting. Therefore, dates will be sorted in chronological order, amount in ascending order, and names and categories in lexicographical order.


===== Aspect: How sort is executed when `[fuchsia]#[ORDER]#` argument is supplied and specified order is opposite to that of default. ([navy]#E.g.# `[fuchsia]#sort -name -desc#`)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A new comparator that imposes the reverse ordering of one of the four defined comparator classes is created. +
(*[navy]#E.g.#* To sort the list by name in reverse lexicographical order, a new comparator, `[fuchsia]#RecordNameComparator#reversed()#` is created.)

** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: List needs to be sorted again using the new comparator. Time will be needed to compare the records in the list.

* **Alternative 2:** Reverse the list after sorting it using one of the four defined comparator classes. +
(*[navy]#E.g.#* Sort list using `[fuchsia]#RecordNameComparator#`. Then use the `[fuchsia]#reverse#` command to reverse the list.)

** Pros: We can reuse what is already in the codebase (`[fuchsia]#reverse#` command).
** Cons: Harder to implement, need to execute two commands internally when one command is entered in the `[fuchsia]#CommandBox#`.

// end::sort[]

// tag::reverse[]
=== Reverse feature

The reverse feature allows users to reverse the list of entries displayed on the graphic user interface.
The sort features are implemented with a default ordering.
The reverse command provides a convenient way for users to sort their entries in reverse order.

==== Current Implementation

This is how the reverse command is implemented:

. `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#execute(_"reverse"_)#` calls `[fuchsia]#FinanceTrackerParser#parseCommand(_"reverse"_)#`.
. `[fuchsia]#FinanceTrackerParser#parseCommand(_"reverse"_)#` creates a `[fuchsia]#ReverseCommand#` object, _r_.
. _r_ is passed back to the `[fuchsia]#FinanceTrackerParser#`, and then back to the `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#`.
. `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#execute(_"reverse"_)#` then moves on to call `[fuchsia]#ReverseCommand#execute()#`.
. `[fuchsia]#ReverseCommand#execute()#` calls `[fuchsia]#Model#reverseFilteredRecordList()#`.
. `[fuchsia]#Model#reverseFilteredRecordList()#` calls `[fuchsia]#FinanceTracker#reverseRecordList()#`.
. `[fuchsia]#FinanceTracker#reverseRecordList()#` calls `[fuchsia]#UniqueRecordList#reverseList()#`.
. `[fuchsia]#UniqueRecordList#reverseList()#` uses `[fuchsia]#FXCollection#`’s static method `[fuchsia]#reverse()#` to reverse the list of records.
. `[fuchsia]#ReverseCommand#execute()#` then creates a `[fuchsia]#CommandResult#` object and returns it back to the `[fuchsia]#LogicManager#`.

.Sequence Diagram of Reverse Command
image::ReverseSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::reverse[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `[fuchsia]#VersionedFinanceTracker#`.
It extends `[fuchsia]#FinanceTracker#` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `[fuchsia]#FinanceTrackerStateList#` and `[fuchsia]#currentStatePointer#`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `[fuchsia]#VersionedFinanceTracker#commit()#` -- Saves the current finance tracker state in its history.
* `[fuchsia]#VersionedFinanceTracker#undo()#` -- Restores the previous finance tracker state from its history.
* `[fuchsia]#VersionedFinanceTracker#redo()#` -- Restores a previously undone finance tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `[fuchsia]#Model#` interface as `[fuchsia]#Model#commitFinanceTracker()#`, `[fuchsia]#Model#undoFinanceTracker()#` and `[fuchsia]#Model#redoFinanceTracker()#` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1.* +
The user launches the application for the first time. The `[fuchsia]#VersionedFinanceTracker#` will be initialized with the initial finance tracker state, and the `[fuchsia]#currentStatePointer#` pointing to that single finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 2.* +
The user executes `[fuchsia]#delete 5#` command to delete the 5th record in the finance tracker. The `[fuchsia]#delete#` command calls `[fuchsia]#Model#commitFinanceTracker()#`, causing the modified state of the finance tracker after the `[fuchsia]#delete 5#` command executes to be saved in the `[fuchsia]#financeTrackerStateList#`, and the `[fuchsia]#currentStatePointer#` is shifted to the newly inserted finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 3.* +
The user executes `[fuchsia]#spend n/burger ...#` to add a new record. The `[fuchsia]#spend#` command also calls `[fuchsia]#Model#commitFinanceTracker()#`, causing another modified finance tracker state to be saved into the `[fuchsia]#financeTrackerStateList#`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `[fuchsia]#Model#commitFinanceTracker()#`, so the finance tracker state will not be saved into the `[fuchsia]#financeTrackerStateList#`.

*Step 4.* +
The user now decides that adding the record was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `[fuchsia]#undo#` command. The `[fuchsia]#undo#` command will call `[fuchsia]#Model#undoFinanceTracker()#`, which will shift the `[fuchsia]#currentStatePointer#` once to the left, pointing it to the previous finance tracker state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `[fuchsia]#currentStatePointer#` is at index 0, pointing to the initial finance tracker state, then there are no previous finance tracker states to restore.
The `[fuchsia]#undo#` command uses `[fuchsia]#Model#canUndoFinanceTracker()#` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `[fuchsia]#redo#` command does the opposite -- it calls `[fuchsia]#Model#redoFinanceTracker()#`, which shifts the `[fuchsia]#currentStatePointer#` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `[fuchsia]#currentStatePointer#` is at index `[fuchsia]#financeTrackerStateList.size() - 1#`, pointing to the latest finance tracker state, then there are no undone finance tracker states to restore. The `[fuchsia]#redo#` command uses `[fuchsia]#Model#canRedoFinanceTracker()#` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

*Step 5.* +
The user then decides to execute the command `[fuchsia]#list#`. Commands that do not modify the finance tracker, such as `[fuchsia]#list#`, will usually not call `[fuchsia]#Model#commitFinanceTracker()#`, `[fuchsia]#Model#undoFinanceTracker()#` or `[fuchsia]#Model#redoFinanceTracker()#`. Thus, the `[fuchsia]#financeTrackerStateList#` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 6.* +
The user executes `[fuchsia]#clear#`, which calls `[fuchsia]#Model#commitFinanceTracker()#`. Since the `[fuchsia]#currentStatePointer#` is not pointing at the end of the `[fuchsia]#financeTrackerStateList#`, all finance tracker states after the `[fuchsia]#currentStatePointer#` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `[fuchsia]#spend n/burger ...#` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire finance tracker.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `[fuchsia]#delete#`, just save the record being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of finance tracker states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `[fuchsia]#HistoryManager#` and `[fuchsia]#VersionedFinanceTracker#`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `[fuchsia]#HistoryManager#` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `[fuchsia]#HistoryManager#` now needs to do two different things.

=== Budget Management

// tag::budgetclassdiagram[]

This group of features allows the user to set a total budget and
allocate a portion of the total budget to different categories.
The current spending will increase when records are added.

This implementation is under `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` and `UI` Component.

The classes associated with Budget is shown in the class diagram below:

.Class Diagram for Budget
image::budget_classdiagram.png[width ="600"]

The above diagram shows the structure of the classes associated with `Budget`.
`TotalBudget` and `CategoryBudget` are sub-classes of `Budget` and `TotalBudget` can contain
any number of `CategoryBudget`.

As seen in the class diagram, the `CategoryBudget` in `TotalBudget` is kept in a `HashSet`.

// end::budgetclassdiagram[]

// tag::budget[]
==== Setting a Budget
This feature allows the user to set a budget for the FinanceTracker. The budget can be changed by setting
the budget again.

Given below is a sequence diagram and step by step explanation of how Finance Tracker
creates a budget when the user uses the `set` command to set a budget.

.Sequence diagram of user setting a budget
image::SetSequenceDiagram.jpg[width="800"]

. The user enters a Set command (e.g. set $/120). The command passed down and received by the `LogicManager`.
. The `LogicManger` calls the `FinanceTrackerParser#ParseCommand()` method which creates a `SetCommandParser`
object. The `FinanceTrackerParser#ParseCommand()` method then calls the `SetCommandParser#parse()` method,
passing in the amount argument entered by the user ("120" in example).
. `SetCommandParser#parse()` calls `ParserUtil#ParseAmount()` to handle the parsing of the amount. The method
checks if the argument is a valid amount value and throws an exception if it is not. If there are no exceptions,
`ParserUtil#ParseAmount()` returns the processed amount string. `SetCommandParser#parse()` then creates a
`SetCommand` with the processed amount ("120" in example) and the new `SetCommand` gets passed back to the
`LogicManager`.
. Now that the command is processed, `LogicManager#execute()` calls `SetCommand#execute()` to execute the command.
`SetCommand#execute()` creates a new `Budget` object initialised with the amount (budget of 120 created in example).
The `Budget` object (labelled p) is then passed to the `ModelManager` by the `ModelManager#addBudget()` method.
. `ModelManager#addBudget()` calls `FinanceTracker#addBudget()` to update the budget of the current instance of the
Finance Tracker. `FinanceTracker#addBudget()` updates the `TotalBudget` object field (labelled q) in `FinanceTracker`
by calling `TotalBudget#updateBudget()` and passing the `Budget p` and the records stored in the `FinanceTracker`.
. `TotalBudget#updateBudget()` first gets the budget data (totalBudget, currentBudget) from `Budget p` and sets it using
`TotalBudget#set()` (total budget of app is now 120 in example). It then updates the current budget and spending based on
the records that was stored and passed in by the `FinanceTracker`.
. Once `TotalBudget q` has finished updating, control is passed all the way back to `SetCommand#execute()` which will create
a `CommandResult` (labelled result). The result is passed back to `LogicManager#execute` and all the way to the user to show
that the budget has been set (Budget set to 120 in example).
. Although not shown in the diagram, the UI is then updated with the new budget. The UI update of budget data will be
covered in <<Updating the UI with Budget Data>>.


==== Design Consideration
Aspect: Updating budget data after Record updates

* *Solution 1*: Maintaining one updateBudget method to update current expenditure and budget left based on
iterating through changed record list.
** Pros: Easier to implement and manage a single method.
** Cons: Updates for even single addition/edit/deletion of record could be slow if record list gets too large.

* *Solution 2*: Maintain individual methods for each update of budget data (add/edit/remove records) (Current Implementation)
** Pros: App would run updates faster with more targeted methods.
** Cons: More code and test cases to be written to implement and maintain several methods for updating budget.
//end::budget[]

// tag::categorybudget[]
==== Allocating a budget to category
This feature allows user to set a category budget after the total budget is set

Given below is a sequence diagram and step by step explanation of how Finance Tracker
executes when a user sets a category budget.

.Sequence diagram of user setting a category budget
image::AllocateSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. User enters command `allocate $/10 c/Food`. The command is received by `FinanceBookParser`
. FinanceTrackerParser will then create a `AllocateCommandParser` Object
and calls `AllocateCommandParser#parse()` method
. `AllocateCommandParser#parse()` method calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` method to tokenize
the user input String into arguments and prefixes in an `ArgumentMultimap` Object.
. `AllocateCommandParser#parse()` method then calls another method within the same class
`AllocateCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` to check if there are any missing prefixes.
If there are missing prefixes, `ParseException` will be thrown
. If no exceptions are thrown from the step 4, a new AllocateCommand object is created
with the given arguments.
. Control is returned to LogicManager which then calls `AllocateCommand#execute()` method.
. `AllocateCommand#execute()` calls `ModelManager#addCategoryBudget()` method and control
is transferred to `ModelManager` which is in the `Model` Component.
. `ModelManager#addCategoryBudget()` then calls `FinanceTracker#addCategoryBudget()` which then
calls `TotalBudget#setNewCategoryBudget()`
. `TotalBudget#setNewCategoryBudget()` takes into account if there are any previous budget
allocated to a category and if so, adds the expenses to the new budget assigned to the category

===== Design consideration
Aspect: allocating Category Budget

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Allocating Category Budget is done with only one command `allocate`
** Pros: User only needs to make use of one command to control the budget of the category and will
not be confused with too many other commands
** Cons: Requires the developer to ensure the application checks that if there is a current budget
allocated to the same category, it should be reflected accordingly.

* *Alternative 2*: Have two other commands `increaseCatBudget` and `decreaseCatBudget` to allow user
to control the budget of the category
** Pros: User is able to adjust the budget by increasing/decreasing the budget and error message will be shown
if the category was not previously allocated with a budget
** Cons: User might be confused with too many commands and not intuitive.
// end::categorybudget[]

// tag::show[]
==== Listing Category Budgets allocated
This feature allows user to list the category budgets and the current spending in these
categories after category budgets are allocated.

==== Implementation
. User enters command `show` in Command Box.
. `ShowCategoryBudgetCommand#execute()` is executed and the method first checks whether there are any allocated category
budgets
. If there are no allocated category budgets, a message will be printed in the ResultDisplay
. If there are allocated category budgets, `Model#getCatBudget()` is called to obtain the set of `CategoryBudget`
. An `Iterator` is then used to iterate through the set of `CategoryBudgets` and the `currentSpending` is printed with
the `totalBudget` allocated to the `CategoryBudget`.
// end::show[]

//tag::budgetupdateui[]
==== Updating the UI with Budget Data
Previous sections have covered how the budget of the Finance Tracker is updated within the App. This section aims
to give a overview of the logic for updating the User Interface of the App to reflect the budget updates to the
user.

To explain the update, an Activity Diagram accompanied with a step-by-step walk-through is proved. The Activity Diagram is modelled after `MainWindow#execute()` which calls the appropriate
methods to update the budget UI.

.Activity diagram of the UI being updated after budget data changes
image::BudgetUiUpdateActivityDiagram.png[]

. The command is first executed by the `LogicManager`. The execution of commands will update the budget data
in the Finance Tracker as specified in previous sections. The success message of the command is then displayed to the user
(Result of command that user typed).
. There is then a conditional check on whether the command has changed the budget data (Based on CommandResult
passed back from command execution). For brevity and based on the scope of the section, the other conditional checks
for the command will be excluded.
List of Commands that change budget: `spend`, `edit`, `delete`, `set`, `allocate`, `clear`, `setfile`, `undo`, `redo`
. When it has been determined that the command has altered budget data, 3 components of the UI need to be updated before
continuing. If you are unfamiliar with the components of the UI, refer to the
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#graphical-user-interface-introduction[Graphical User Interface] section of our User Guide.
.. *BudgetPanel*:
The BudgetPanel consists of 2 sections, the Budget Bar and the text below the bar. The bar and text is updated with
data retrieved from the `Logic` component of the App, with the changes to Budget Bar being animated. The colour of
the bar is then set based on the difference in current spending and total budget set (Red: Budget Exceeded, Yellow: Spending is
>= 80% of budget, Green: Spending is <80% of budget).
.. *Browser Panel*:
The BrowserPanel only contains text and is updated similar to the text in the BudgetPanel.
.. *Summary Panel*:
The SummaryPanel consists of a pie chart. If the updated budget data shows no expense recorded within the specified time period,
text explaining that there is no recorded expenses is shown to the user instead. Else, the summary data is updated and the pie
chart is edited to reflect changes in the expenditures. Refer to <<Summary>> for a more detailed explanation of the implementation
of the feature.
. After the UI is updated, there is another check to see if the command given was `summary`. If it was, the current Panel being
displayed (BrowserPanel or SummaryPanel) is swapped to the other panel. Again, refer to the Summary section below for more implementation
details.
. The method ends by returning the CommandResult that was returned from the execution of command to the MainApp.
//end::budgetupdateui[]
//end::budgetmanagement[]


// tag::summary[]
=== Summary
The summary feature shows an overview of your previous expenditures in a pie chart. Each sector of the chart represents a category, labelled with the name and total expenditure for each category.

You can also set a report period by indicating the number of days or months. Specifying a report period is optional. If no parameters are defined, data of expenditures in the past week (ie. the last 7 days) will be displayed in the pie chart by default.

==== Implementation
The implementation of the Summary command can be divided into two phases – preparation and execution. Given below is an explanation of how the summary mechanism behaves at each phase.

===== Preparation
In the preparation phase, the application will parse the command. Below is the UML Sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of the preparation stage.

.Sequence diagram of the preparation stage in the summary mechanism
image::SummarySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

1.	User first enters the command `summary #/7 p/d`. This command is received by `FinanceTrackerParser`, which then calls `SummaryCommandParser#parse()` to create `SummaryCommand`.
2.	If no parameters are provided by the user, `SummaryCommand#SummaryCommand()` is called to create `SummaryCommand` with the default parameters of ` periodAmount ` as `7` and `period` as `d`. Otherwise, `SummaryCommand#SummaryCommand(periodAmount, period)` is called to create `SummaryCommand` with the specified parameters.
3.	`SummaryCommand` then checks if the parameters are valid. If any parameter is invalid, an exception will be thrown, and an error message will be shown to the user. Else, the parameters are stored in instance variables and `SummaryCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`.
4.	`LogicManager` then calls `SummaryCommand#execute()`, which updates the variables `RecordSummaryPredicate`, `summaryPeriod` and `periodAmount` in `ModelManager`.

===== Execution
In the execution phase, the program handles `ShowSummaryRequestEvent` posted by `SummaryCommand` to retrieve the data to be displayed. The data will be rendered as a JavaFX `PieChart` and then displayed. Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of the execution stage.

.Sequence diagram of the execution stage in the summary mechanism
image::SummarySequenceDiagram2.png[width="800"]

1.	The`handleShowSummary` will be handled by `MainWindow#handleShowSummary()`, which will call `SummaryPanel#setData()` and pass the data as parameters by calling `Logic#getRecordSummary()`, `Logic#getSummaryPeriod()`  and `Logic#getPeriodAmount()`.
2.	`Logic#getRecordSummary()` gets the filtered record list by calling `Model#getRecordSummary()`, which returns an unmodifiable ObservableList, only containing only expenses in the last 7 days.
3.	`Logic#getRecordSummary()` then organises the data into a `LinkedHashMap<String, Double>`, where the key value pair represents category and cost.
4.	`Logic#getSummaryPeriod()`  and `Logic#getPeriodAmount()` get their respective data by calling the method of the same name in `Model`.
5.	Once the parameters are passed into `SummaryPanel#setData()`, `StackPane#getChildren()#clear()` is called to clear any display elements in `StackPane`. JavaFX’s `PieChart` is then used to render the summary pie chart. There are two possible scenarios which could happen:
i) If the data received is empty, a `Text` object is generated and `StackPane#getChildren()#add()` is called, which informs the user that there are no expenditures.
ii)	Else, `SummaryPanel#setSummaryData()` will be called, which generates a Pie Chart and calls `StackPane#getChildren()#add()`, which adds it to `StackPane`. This is shown in the code snippet below:

    public void setSummaryData(LinkedHashMap<String, Double> summaryData) {
            PieChart pieChart = new PieChart();
            Set<String> keySet = summaryData.keySet();
            for (String s : keySet) {
                pieChart.getData().add(new PieChart.Data(s, summaryData.get(s)));
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < pieChart.getData().size(); i++) {
                PieChart.Data data = pieChart.getData().get(i);
                data.getNode().getStyleClass().add(getPieChartColorStyleFor(data.getName()));
                data.nameProperty().bind(Bindings.concat(data.getName(), " - $",
                                        String.format("%.2f", data.getPieValue())));
            }
            pieChart.setLegendSide(Side.BOTTOM);
            chartArea.getChildren().add(pieChart);
    }

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Representation for Summary of Expenditure

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Represent summary of expenses using a pie chart

.Current Implementation of Summary Panel using JavaFX's `PieChart`
image::summaryPanel.png[width="600"]

** Pros: Labels can act as a legend as well as there might be categories with similar colours. This will help the user to easily identify the expenditures in different categories.
** Cons: If there are too many categories, the labels may not show up as it will clash with the other labels. The data presented may also become too cluttered as well.

* *Alternative 2 (planned for `[v2.0]`)*: Represent summary of expenses using an Aster Plot graph

In `v2.0` of _In-Credit-Ble_, the summary feature intends to use a D3.js Aster Plot graph to display the summary of expenditures instead of the current pie chart. This will help contribute to the aesthetics and user-friendliness of displaying the data in _In-Credit-Ble_.

.Example of Aster Plot Graph
image::asterPlot.png[width="400"]

Each sector of the chart represents a category. The area of each sector indicates the total budget amount allocated for a particular category, while the coloured area of the sector denotes the amount spent for that category. On mouseover of each sector, a pop-up display of the category name and amount spent for each category will be shown. The colours used for the category in the aster plot graph should also correspond to the same colour palette used for the category labels.

** Pros: More effective in showing the user what is the remaining budget amount for each category. It also allows users to easily perceive whether their spending is within their budget for each category.
** Cons: Difficult to implement as it requires linking to D3, a third party JavaScript library for data visualisations via HTML, SVG, and CSS.

//end::summary[]

// tag::theme[]
=== Theme
The `theme` feature allows users to change the colour theme of the application to provide
them with some customisation.

==== Implementation
. User enters command `theme COLOUR` in Command Box, where `COLOUR` is either `dark`, `light`, `blue` or `pink`
. `ThemeCommand#formatTheme()` is executed to change the user input of COLOUR to a word that has
first character in uppercase and the rest of the characters in lowercase.
. `ThemeCommand#isValidTheme()` is then used to check if the COLOUR is one of the four specified above.
. `ThemeCommand` then returns a `CommandResult` that sets the boolean field `changeTheme` to true
. `MainWindow#handleSwitchTheme()` is then executed to call the appropriate method to switch the theme of the application
to the user-specified input
// end::theme[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing noteworthy actions by the application
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.finance.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.finance.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.finance.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.finance.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, _In-Credit-Ble_ depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
