== Introduction

Welcome to the _In-Credit-Ble_ Developer Guide!

_In-Credit-Ble_ is a finance tracker application created to simplify the managing and tracking
of the user’s personal finances. With _In-Credit-Ble_, users will be able to stick to their budget
and be more aware of their spending habits.

This developer guide specifies the design and implementation of _In-Credit-Ble_. The intended audience of
this document is the developers, designers and software testers of our application.

Please continue on to the <<Setting Up, Setting Up>> section to get started. You can also read <<AboutUs#, AboutUs.adoc>>
and <<ContactUs#, ContactUs.adoc>> for more information on how to contact us!

== Setting Up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to menu:File[Settings > Plugins] to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click menu:File[Close Project] to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click menu:Configure[Project Defaults > Project Structure]
.. Click btn:[New...] and find the directory of the JDK
. Click btn:[Import Project]
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click btn:[OK]
. Click btn:[Open as Project]
. Click btn:[OK] to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select btn:[Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options] for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/finance/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `seedu.finance.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to menu:File[Settings...] (Windows/Linux), or menu:IntelliJ IDEA[Preferences...] (macOS)
. Select menu:Editor[Code Style > Java]
. Click on the btn:[Imports] tab to set the order

* For btn:[Class count to use import with '\*'] and btn:[Names count to use static import with '*']: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For btn:[Import Layout]: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a btn:[<blank line>] between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `In-Credit-Ble`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.


==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* above explains the high-level design of _In-Credit-Ble_. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose btn:[Save as picture].

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* App launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* App shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and
exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How do the architecture components interact with each other?

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteRecord.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RecordListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FinanceTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a record).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Finance Tracker data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Record>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Category` list in `Finance Tracker`, which `Record` can reference.
This would allow `Finance Tracker` to only require one `Category` object per unique `Category`, instead of each `Record` needing their own `Category` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/finance/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Finance Tracker data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.financetracker.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes in detail the implementation of certain features in _In-Credit-Ble_.

=== Searching by tag feature

This feature allows the user to filter out specific expenses by entering a certain tag (eg food).

This implementation is under `Logic` and `Model` Component.

_Sequence diagram to be done soon_

==== To be implemented

1. User enters command `findTag food`. The command is received by `FinanceTrackerParser`,
which then creates a `FindTagCommandParser` Object and calls `FindCommandParser#parse()` method.

2.  `FindTagCommandParser#parse()` method then calls `ParserUtil#ensureKeywordsAreValid()` method. If any
of the keywords does not follow the correct format, `ParseException` will be thrown.

3. A `FindTagCommand` Object is created and returned to the `LogicManager`.

4. `LogicManager` then calls `FindTagCommand#execute()`, which calls Mode#updateFilteredExpenseList() method
to update a filterList based on the given predicate.

5. Then the record list panel will show a set of records according to the keywords. A `CommandResult` is then created
and returned to `Logic Manager`.

==== Design Consideration

This feature can be implemented in different ways in terms of how the records are found.

* *Alternative 1* : Check through all records and select those with the matched `tag`

** Pros: Easy to implement without changing original architecture.
** Cons: Slow. Tend to take a long time to search through large number of records.

* *Alternative 2* : Each time a new tag is created, create a new list. Each of these list will hold
all the records of a particular tag.

** Pros: Very efficient, each time the command is called, just need to retrieve the list of the wanted tag.
** Cons: Need to change the original architecture of storage to introduce storing of different list corresponding to
each tag. Will take up more space if there is many different tags.


=== Sort feature

By default, the list of entries is ordered according to the time the entry is entered into the application,
where the entry entered first will be at the top of the list, and the entry entered last is at the bottom of the list.
The sort mechanism allows users to view their expense records in a different way.


==== Current Implementation

*_Details of implementation will be added next time._*

==== Design Considerations

*_Design considerations will be added next time._*

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedFinanceTracker`.
It extends `FinanceTracker` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `FinanceTrackerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedFinanceTracker#commit()` -- Saves the current finance tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedFinanceTracker#undo()` -- Restores the previous finance tracker state from its history.
* `VersionedFinanceTracker#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone finance tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`, `Model#undoFinanceTracker()` and `Model#redoFinanceTracker()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1.* +
The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFinanceTracker` will be initialized with the initial finance tracker state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 2.* +
The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th record in the finance tracker. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`, causing the modified state of the finance tracker after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `financeTrackerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 3.* +
The user executes `spend n/burger ...` to add a new record. The `spend` command also calls `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`, causing another modified finance tracker state to be saved into the `financeTrackerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`, so the finance tracker state will not be saved into the `financeTrackerStateList`.

*Step 4.* +
The user now decides that adding the record was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoFinanceTracker()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous finance tracker state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial finance tracker state, then there are no previous finance tracker states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoFinanceTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoFinanceTracker()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `financeTrackerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest finance tracker state, then there are no undone finance tracker states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoFinanceTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

*Step 5.* +
The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the finance tracker, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`, `Model#undoFinanceTracker()` or `Model#redoFinanceTracker()`. Thus, the `financeTrackerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 6.* +
The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `financeTrackerStateList`, all finance tracker states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `spend n/burger ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire finance tracker.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the record being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of finance tracker states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedFinanceTracker`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::budgetmanagement[]
=== Budget Management

This group of features allows the user to set a total budget and
allocate a portion of the total budget to different categories.
The current spending will increase when records are added.

This implementation is under `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` and `UI` Component.
// tag::budget[]
==== Setting a Budget
This feature allows the particular user to set a budget for the FinanceTracker. The user
may only set the budget once and increase or decrease it later.

Given below is a sequence diagram and step by step explanation of how Finance Tracker
creates a budget when the user sets a budget.

.Sequence diagram of user setting a budget
image::SetCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user enters a Set command (e.g. set $/120). The command is received by MainWindow and
the method `LogicManager#execute()` is called. The argument of the command ($/120) is passed to
`FinanceTrackerParser#parseCommand` method to handle.
. The `FinanceTrackerParser#parseCommand` creates a `SetCommandParser` object and passes the command
arguments into `SetCommandParser#parse()` method. The argument is checked to be in the correct format
by `ParserUtil.parseAmount()` before `SetCommandParser#parse()` creates a `SetCommand` with the argument
parsed into an amount passed in.
. The `SetCommand` object is passed back to `LogicManager#execute()` and it calls the `SetCommand#execute()`
to excute the logic to create the budget. The method creates a `Budget` object with the amount and passes
the budget object into the `Model` by calling `ModelManager#addBudget()`.
. `ModelManager#addBudget()` calls `FinanceTracker#addBudget()` to set the Budget of the FinanceTracker for
the current user of the app. `FinanceTracker#addBudget()` uses the `Budget#set()` method to set the Budget of
the app using the amount put in the inital command before returning to the `SetCommand#execute()` in the `Logic`
of the app.
. `SetCommand#execute()` now creates a `CommandResult` object to convey a message to be pushed to the UI and user.
The `commandresult` object created is passed back to `LogicManager#execute()` and then back to `MainWindow#executeCommand()`.
. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` checks whether there is a need to update the budget in the UI by calling `commandResult#isChangeBudget()`
and getting a `true` boolean return from the method for the set command. The `#handleChangeBudget()` within `MainWindow` is called
since `MainWindow#executeCommand()` notes that budget is changed.
. `MainWindow#handleChangeBudget()` calls `LogicManager#getBudget()` to get the current budget of the FinanceTracker. The budget is then
passed as argument into the `BrowserPanel#updateBudget()` method which will reflect the budget set by the command in the UI. The current budget
will be the same as the total budget when it is set.


==== Design Consideration
The logic for keeping track of budgets can be implemented in different ways for individual categories.

* *Solution 1*: Keep a list of expenditure for individual categories and budget allocations in one Budget class.
** Pros: Easier to maintain one Budget object.
** Cons: Iterating through the list could be slow if there are a lot of categories. Lists could be confusing to maintain.

* *Solution 2*: Create Budget classes to keep track of expenditure and budget for individual categories.
** Pros: More human readable to maintain Budget classes with names of categories.
** Cons: Budget classes for individual categories need to be iterated through to get totals leading to slow UI updates each time values are changed.

//end::budget[]

// tag::categorybudget[]
==== Allocating a budget to category
This feature allows user to set a category budget after the total budget is set

Given below is a sequence diagram and step by step explanation of how Finance Tracker
executes when a user sets a category budget.

.Sequence diagram of user setting a category budget
image::AllocateSequenceDiagram.png[]


. User enters command `allocate $/10 c/Food`. The command is received by `FinanceBookParser`
. FinanceTrackerParser will then create a `AllocateCommandParser` Object
and calls `AllocateCommandParser#parse()` method
. `AllocateCommandParser#parse()` method calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` method to tokenize
the user input String into arguments and prefixes in an `ArgumentMultimap` Object.
. `AllocateCommandParser#parse()` method then calls another method within the same class
`AllocateCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` to check if there are any missing prefixes.
If there are missing prefixes, `ParseException` will be thrown
. If no exceptions are thrown from the step 4, a new AllocateCommand object is created
with the given arguments.
. Control is returned to LogicManager which then calls `AllocateCommand#execute()` method.
. `AllocateCommand#execute()` calls `ModelManager#addCategoryBudget()` method and control
is transferred to `ModelManager` which is in the `Model` Component.
. `ModelManager#addCategoryBudget()` then calls `FinanceTracker#addCategoryBudget()` which then
calls `TotalBudget#setNewCategoryBudget()`
. `TotalBudget#setNewCategoryBudget()` takes into account if there are any previous budget
allocated to a category and if so, adds the expenses to the new budget assigned to the category

===== Design consideration
Aspect: allocating Category Budget

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Allocating Category Budget is done with only one command `allocate`
** Pros: User need to only make use of one command to control the budget of the category and will
not be confused with too many other commands
** Cons: Requires the developer to ensure the application checks that if there is a current budget
allocated to the same category, it should be reflected accordingly.

* *Alternative 2*: Have two other commands `increaseCatBudget` and `decreaseCatBudget` to allow user
to control the budget of the category
** Pros: User is able to adjust the budget by increasing/decreasing the budget instead of having to use
one command to allocate a fixed amount to the budget
** Cons: User might be confused with too many commands and not intuitive.
// end::categorybudget[]


==== To be implemented
* Reflecting total budget and current budget on `BrowserPanel` portion of UI.
* Implementing logic for `increase` command to allow for increasing the budget.
* Modify `spend` and `edit` Command to deduct from total budget to get current budget.
* Implement `reset` command to reset current budget expenditure and total budget.
* Reflecting total budget and current budget for each category when selected in UI.
* Expand `undo` and `redo` command to be able to work on `set`, `allocate` and `increase` command.

//end::budgetmanagement[]


// tag::summary[]
=== Summary

The summary feature shows an overview of your previous expenditures. It displays statistics on how your spending habits are like in the different categories you have specified. It also displays the remaining budget amount for each category.

==== To be implemented
The summary feature intends to use a D3.js graph to display the data. This will help contribute to the aesthetics and user-friendliness of displaying the data in the financeTracker.

The summary command will retrieve the whole list of existing records, which will then be parsed by SummaryCommandParser. This will return the appropriate d3 graph to be shown.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the summary mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The financeTracker will be initialised with the existing records the user has input last time.

Step 2. The user executes the summary command. Input is parsed and the records will be extracted.

Step 3. The records are then converted to JSON, and data will be used to map the d3 graph.


_Sequence Diagram will be done soon_

==== Design Consideration
An aster plot graph will be used to display the information in the main window. Using such a graph will allow for sufficient space should users decide to add more categories in the future. Hovering over the different sectors in the aster plot graph will display the corresponding category. If possible, the colours used for the category in the aster plot graph should be the same colour palette used for the category labels.

.Example of Aster Plot Graph
image::asterPlot.png[width="400"]

Initially, we were considering using a pie chart instead. However, using an aster plot graph will be more effective in showing the user what is the remaining budget amount for each category.
//end::summary[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing noteworthy actions by the application
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.finance.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.finance.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.finance.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.finance.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, _In-Credit-Ble_ depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
