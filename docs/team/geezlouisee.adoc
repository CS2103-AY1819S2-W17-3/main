== PROJECT: In-Credit-Ble

== Overview

image::Ui_2.png[]

_In-Credit-Ble_ is an expense tracker that is tailored to help users manage their finances and keep track of their budget in an easy and efficient manner. It is designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), especially for those who prefer to type over using their mouse.

_In-Credit-Ble_ was developed by four friends and I, from the National University of Singapore. This product was developed as part of our Software Engineering module, CS2103T. We had to adapt to an existing codebase in Java and develop a functional product in a short span of 13 weeks. In this project portfolio, I will be documenting my personal contributions to this project.

== Summary of contributions
This section summarises my contributions towards the code, documentation, as well as other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement*: added *Summary* command to represent the overview of expenses in a graphical form
** What it does: Allows the user to view an overview of all their expenditures in a single graph. Each sector represents a category and gets “filled up” according to the percentage spent of the allocated budget for that particular sector.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will be able to see a quick overview of their spending in a pictorial form. This allows users to easily perceive whether their spending is within their budget for each category.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was also quite challenging as it required linking to third party libraries.
** Credits: Usage of D3, a JavaScript library for data visualisations via HTML, SVG, and CSS.
