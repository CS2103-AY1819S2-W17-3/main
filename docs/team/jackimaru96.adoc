This page aims to showcase my contributions to the project
*In-Credit-Ble* under module _CS2103T_. I will be giving you an introduction to *In-Credit-Ble*,
followed by summarising my contributions. Lastly, I will be showing you the relevant sections of User Guide and
Development Guide that I documented.  I hope that after reading through this page, you will have a better
understanding of my contributions to this project. +

This project was developed with the following utilities:

== PROJECT: In-Credit-Ble (Finance Tracker)

---

== Overview

_In-Credit-Ble_ is a desktop Finance Tracker that is tailored to help users manage their finances
and keep track of their budget in an easy and efficient manner. It is designed for those who
prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), especially for those who prefer to type over
using their mouse.

_In-Credit-Ble_ was developed by my team and I (a total of 5 students) from the National University of Singapore
as part of a Software Engineering module (CS2103T). As part of the module requirement,
 we had to adapt to an existing codebase in Java and develop a functional product in a short
 span of 13 weeks while learning new software engineering concepts. We have chosen to
 morph the existing application into another (from an Address Book to a Finance Tracker).
 In the following sections, I will be documenting my contributions to this project through the major
 and minor features implemented for _In-Credit-Ble_.

== Summary of Contributions
|===
|This section will give you a brief overview of my contributions to the project such as the features that I implemented
as well as the other notable contributions in terms of _Project Management_ and participating in forums.
This section will be split into *Major Enhancement*, *Minor Enhancements* and *Notable Contributions* sub-sections.

* *Major enhancement*: added `CategoryBudget`
** *_What it does_*: Allows user to set a budget for categories so as to keep track
of the expenses for each category (such as `Food`, `Travel`, `Clothes`).
It ensures that the sum of budget of each category does not exceed the total budget
of the Finance Tracker.
** *_Justification_*: This feature improves the product significantly and enhances user
ability to manage their expenses according to categories. For a finance tracker, it is important
as this will allow the user to categorise their spending to know which area he/she should
start spending less and which category they are able to increase their spending. It also requires
integration of the `Logic`, `Model` and `UI` components of the project.

* Highlights of feature:
*** This enhancement can be triggered using the `allocate` command. Each of the category
budget is stored in the `TotalBudget` class which is implemented in the `Model` component.
*** Each category budget will be displayed on the UI to show the user the current spending
for that category over the total budget allocated for it.

** *Minor enhancement*: Changing theme of application
* _What it does_: Allows user to change the colour theme of the application to pre-set themes
such as `Dark`, `Light`, `Blue`, `Pink`.
* _Justification_: This feature allows the user to have minor customisation of their In-Credit-Ble
Finance Tracker Application
* Highlights of feature:
*** This feature can be triggered using the `theme` command. Triggering this command will result in
the `UI` component changing its stylesheet to fit the pre-set themes indicated by the user.

== Contributions to the User Guide
|===
|The next section will include my contribution to the User Guide. It will showcase my ability
in documenting a reader-friendly User Guide that is aimed at the end-users of _In-Credit-Ble_.
It is important to be able to write a user-friendly guide that will allow the users to quickly grasp
how to use our application. +

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
|===
|The following section will include the sections of my contribution to the Developer Guide.
It showcases my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my code contributions.
This is important as in real-world software engineering projects, we are expected to work in team and being able to
document Developer Guide well will allow colleagues or other developers to understand what we have coded better. +
