== PROJECT: In-Credit-Ble (Finance Tracker)

---

== Overview

_In-Credit-Ble_ is a desktop Finance Tracker that is tailored to help users manage their finances
and keep track of their budget in an *easy and efficient* manner. It is designed for those who
prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), especially for those who prefer to type over
using their mouse.

_In-Credit-Ble_ was developed by my team and I (a total of 5 students) from the National University of Singapore
as part of a Software Engineering module (CS2103T). As part of the module requirement,
 we had to morph an existing application and develop a functional product in a short
 span of 13 weeks while learning new software engineering concepts. We have chosen to
 morph the existing application from an Address Book to a Finance Tracker.
 In the following sections, I will be summarising my contributions to this project through the major
 and minor features implemented for _In-Credit-Ble_.

== Summary of Contributions
|===
|This section will give you a brief overview of my contributions to the project such as the features that I implemented
as well as the other notable contributions in terms of _Project Management_ and participating in forums. +

This section will be split into *Major Enhancement*, *Minor Enhancements* and *Notable Contributions* sub-sections.

=== Features Contributed to Project

==== Major enhancement: added `CategoryBudget`
** *_What it does_*: Allows user to set a budget for categories so as to keep track
of the expenses for each category (such as `Food`, `Travel`, `Clothes`).
It ensures that the sum of budget of each category does not exceed the total budget
of the Finance Tracker.
** *_Justification_*: This feature improves the product significantly and enhances user
ability to manage their expenses according to categories. For a finance tracker, it is important
as this will allow the user to categorise their spending to know which area he/she should
start spending less and which category they are able to increase their spending. It also requires
integration of the `Logic`, `Model` and `UI` components of the project.

** *_Highlights of feature:_*
*** This enhancement can be triggered using the `allocate` command. Each of the category
budget is stored in the `TotalBudget` class which is implemented in the `Model` component.

*** Each category budget can be shown to the user in the Result Display when the user executes the `show`
command. It shows the current spending over the the total budget allocated for each individual category.


==== Minor enhancement: Changing theme of application
** *_What it does_:* Allows user to change the colour theme of the application to pre-set themes
such as `Dark`, `Light`, `Blue`, `Pink`.
** *_Justification_:* This feature allows the user to have minor customisation of their In-Credit-Ble
Finance Tracker Application
** *_Highlights of feature:_*
*** This feature can be triggered using the `theme` command. Triggering this command will result in
the `UI` component changing its stylesheet to fit the pre-set themes indicated by the user.

=== Other Contributions
==== Notable Contributions
** *Project Management*
*** *Manging Issue Tracker*
**** Added the necessary issue type labels as specified by course requirement. +
(e.g. `type.Story`, `type.Enhancement`, `status.onGoing`, `status.Completed`, `priorityHigh`)

== Contributions to the User Guide
|===
|The next section will include my contribution to the User Guide. It showcases my ability
in documenting a reader-friendly User Guide that is designed for the new users of _In-Credit-Ble_.
It is important to be able to write a user-friendly guide that will allow new users to quickly grasp
how to use our application. +
|===

[NOTE]
====
To allow users to get started with our application with ease, I've created the `Quick Start` and
`Graphical User Interface Introduction` (GUI) sections. These two extracted sections from
the User Guide shows how I am able to use diagrams
to support my writing so that users can have visual aids to guide their understanding. +

Due to page limit constraints, I will only be listing the major portion of my contribution.

[NOTE]
====
The following sections extracted from the User Guide are the instructions to users on how to use the features that I have
implemented for this project. It includes the `allocate`, `show` and `theme` commands.
These three sections show my ability to describe the feature in simple terms that new users are able to comprehend.
In addition, examples on how to use the commands are also included so that the users are able to
follow in a sequential manner. +

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
|===
|The following section will include the sections of my contribution to the Developer Guide.
It showcases my ability to write technical documentation and illustrates the technical depth of my code contributions.
This is important in real-world software engineering projects where we are expected to work in teams. Being able to
document the Developer Guide well will allow colleagues or other developers to understand our implementation better. +
