This page aims to showcase my contribution to the project _In-Credit-Ble_ in tandem with the software engineering
module (CS2103T).

== PROJECT: In-Credit-Ble

---

== Overview

_In-Credit-Ble_ is a Finance Tracker created in order to assist fellow students who have difficulty keeping track of
their daily expenses due to the multitude of micro-transactions that they encounter in their daily life. By allowing
users to easily record their transactions and navigate through their numerous expenses, we hope to help to provide our
users with a hassle-free way of managing their expenses.

_In-Credit-Ble_ was developed by a team of five students from the National University of Singapore
as part of a Software Engineering module (CS2103T). In a short span of 3 months, we have to understand the basic
structure of a software and adapt the source code of a addressBook into our finance tracker application.
I will be documenting my contributions to this project through the major and minor features implemented for
_In-Credit-Ble_.

== Summary of Contributions

*Enhancement Added*: I added the ability to find records based on name, category or dates.

*What it does*: The `search` command allows the user to search for records based on keyword that correspond to the
records' name, category or date depending on the flag that user input. The sum of all results of the search is also
displayed to allow user to know how much money he/she has spent on a particular type of transaction.

*Justification*: In the midst of numerous records that the user has recorded in the application, this function will
allow the user to filter out certain transactions record that he is interested in. Having the sum of these records will
also allow the user to know how much money he/she has spent for either a particular category, date or item.

*Highlights*: This enhancement can be triggered using the 'search' command. This feature is also expandable in
to filter out different kind of records by adding additional categories in which the user can search with.
